# About Brew

Welcome to **Brew**, a Coffee Shop Finder project! This project is a collaborative effort between a frontend team of five and a backend team of four students. Our mission is to create an application that simplifies the discovery of coffee shops and boba places based on user preferences, including location, ambiance, price range, and dietary restrictions.

## Our Vision

Coffee Shop Finder aims to be your go-to guide for finding the perfect coffee spot. Whether you're looking for a quiet place to focus, a cozy corner for a date, or a lively location to catch up with friends, our platform strives to connect you with the best coffee experiences tailored to your needs.

## Project Overview

The Coffee Shop Finder leverages the power of modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience. The application is built using `Next.js` and `TypeScript` for the frontend, enhanced with `TailwindCSS` for styling and `shadcn/ui` for ready-made UI components. Our backend team is developing an API server that fetches data from **Yelp** to present a wide array of coffee shop options to our users.

## Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the invaluable data provided by **Yelp API** and **Google Maps API**. We use `Yelp`'s extensive database to source information on coffee shops, including user reviews, ratings, and location details. `Google Maps API` plays a crucial role in our location search functionality, helping users find coffee shops in their vicinity or specific areas.

## Ethical Use of Data

It's important to note that Coffee Shop Finder is a class project designed for educational purposes. **There is no intention to use this application for profit**. We are committed to using the data from `Yelp` and `Google Maps` responsibly and in accordance with their terms of service. Our goal is purely to create a learning experience that explores the integration of external APIs within a full-stack application.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** For efficient server-side rendering and quick navigation.
- **TypeScript:** Adds type safety to enhance code quality and developer experience.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first `CSS` framework for rapid UI development.
- **shadcn/ui:** Provides a collection of React components that we can modify easily to fit with our design.

## Future Directions

As we continue to develop Coffee Shop Finder, we are open to exploring additional features such as map integrations or advanced personalization based on user preferences.

## Contribution and Feedback

As this is a class project, contributions are currently limited to team members. However, we welcome feedback, suggestions, and ideas on how to improve Coffee Shop Finder. Please feel free to reach out through our project repository or contact the project lead directly.
